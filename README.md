Codes and tutorials related o Silicon Labs MG24 Tech Lab workshop sessions 


## techLAB description 

Join the latest hands-on workshop featuring our highest performing 2.4 GHz Wireless SoC
Learn about the features of the EFR32MG24 wireless SoC including advanced AI/ML capabilities while getting hands-on experience with the help of Silicon Labs' expert engineers. Each project session will explore and solve challenges developers often face when designing battery-powered IoT end devices.

Attendees will be provided our EFR32xG24 Dev Kit (xG24-DK2601B) for the hands-on sessions.  This board is a feature-packed wireless development platform based on the EFR32MG24 SoC that provides debug capability, numerous sensors as well as expansion headers, making it an ideal platform for demonstration, proof of concept and development of IoT end devices. 

Attendees will have access to live Q&A and 1:1 support to assist in completing the documented and recorded exercises. Registrants are encouraged to follow along with their own Silicon Labs' MG24 Development Kit, available to all registrants.
